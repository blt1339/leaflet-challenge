### Level 1: Basic Visualization - Leaflet-Step-1
Utilizing the seven day all earthquake data from [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) a map is creating using Leaflet and JavaScript.  The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.  A ledgend is included to indicate the colors and the depths of the earthquake.  The legend goes away when the earthquake layer is removed and returns with it is added back onto the map.

### Level 2: More Data (Optional) - Leaflet-Step-2
A second map is created with the same earthquake information as step 1.   Additional base maps are added (light, dark, street, outdoors, and satellite street).  An additional layer of the tectonic plate bounderies found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates> is available as well.
